# **Gallery of Things**
---

### **_React Gallery_**
This app shows a gallery of photos of things that I enjoy with a button below each one to click if anyone loves the photo. It shows how many likes a photo has on it as well.

---

### **_Setup_**
Running the server code requires `nodemon`. If you don't already have `nodemon`, install it globally with `npm install nodemon --global`.

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

```
npm run client
```
